		<p class="story">"If I would’ve known back then that those were the symptoms of anxiety, and that other people feel like this too, it would’ve saved me a lot of time finding the right things to help with it.”
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		How has mental health impacted your life?
		<br>
		<br>
		When I was a senior in high school I lost somebody that was basically my brother to suicide and it completely changed everything for me. I had always wanted to work in non-profit after volunteering with the Red Cross when I was younger, but that was the beginning of me being interested in something mental health related too. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Then I came up to Chicago a few years later, found Hope for the Day and I felt so at home right away. And the more I got educated and heard other people’s stories, the more I realized that back in high school everyday I was experiencing all of the symptoms of anxiety - I just also had bad luck with my first counselor who told me my “emotions are just close to the surface.” 
		<br>
		<br>
		So I spent years in the mindset that I was just an over-emotional person.. but if I would’ve known back then that those were the symptoms of anxiety, and that other people feel like this too, it would’ve saved me a lot of time finding the right things to help with it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		What gives you hope?
		<br>
		<br>
		Getting involved and seeing other people resonate with our message gives me hope, and people being open with their emotions, as well as people being accepting of it! Even on a bad day, I feel so energized hearing others connect over their experiences with mental health and being out in the field with people who believe in what we’re doing is the best feeling. Everybody in the room is going through something whether they’re showing it or not. It could be something small, or it could be something major, but just one person realizing that they’re not alone makes it worth it.</p>
